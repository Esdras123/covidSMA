We present in this work the modeling the spreading of the new variant COVID-19 in Cameroon using Multi Agent System and the epidemiological system modeling SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered). The aim of this work is to respond to the problem of modelling the evolution of epidemics with a high transmission rate like COVID-19 in order to get more insights for decision making to slow down the spread. Our solution is outlined in two parts : the former concerned the application of SIR model and the later concerned the tailoring of the former by using Multi Agent System. Multiagent systems are used to model SIR model entities, including residents of a given region. The experiment carried out show that the merging of these two concepts is very useful for decision-making for example : The wearing of the mask
